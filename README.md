# 3D-Python-Game
3D-Game in Python using Panda3d framework.

## Description

A simple 3d-game, built using **Panda3D** in **Python** and all the graphic work is done using **Blender**.
The game which remains **nameless** mostly consists of puzzels and a few just for fun levels.
Some levels require access to your Webcam, they use **OpenCV** and **Machine Learning Framework** to create a environment where the level can be played using **Hand Gestures**.
The puzzels are of random difficulty and each level has at least one puzzle (number of levels not defined).
